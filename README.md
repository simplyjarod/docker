# Docker CE installation and configuration for CentOS 6 & 7

Please, **download _all files_ before executing any script**. There are several dependencies between them. You can use:
```bash
yum install wget unzip -y
wget https://github.com/simplyjarod/docker/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd docker-master
chmod u+x *.sh -R
```

## Installation
Run `./setup.sh` as **root** from the folder this file is placed.
